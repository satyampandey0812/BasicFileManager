# BasicFileManager
Building a basic file manager in C++ involves several steps. Below are the theoretical steps involved:

1. **Include Necessary Headers**: Include the necessary C++ standard library headers for file operations, input/output, and directory handling.
   
2. **Define Functions for File Operations**: Write functions to perform basic file operations such as creating, reading, writing, and deleting files.

3. **Define Functions for Directory Operations**: Write functions to list files in a directory and navigate between directories.

4. **Implement the Main Program Loop**: Use a loop to continuously prompt the user for actions and perform the corresponding operations.

5. **Compile the Code**: Use a C++ compiler to compile the code.

6. **Run the Executable**: After compiling successfully, run the resulting executable.

These steps provide a basic framework for building a file manager in C++. Depending on the complexity and features you want to include in your file manager, you may need to expand upon these steps and add additional functionality.
